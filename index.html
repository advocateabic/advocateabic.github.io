        <meta name="description" content="Immigrants entering the US through a work visa have the opportunity to apply for a green card or permanent residency. However, the problem is these green cards are issued on the basis of an applicants nation of origin. In the current system, a small country like Switzerland is issued the same amount of green cards as a much larger country like India. This has resulted in up to 150 years of wait times for over 1 million Indian and Chinese immigrants & families to get green cards. Senate Bill S386 eliminates this country cap on the issuing of employment-based green cards and transitions to a more fair first come first serve system. However, there is 1 Senator opposes to this bill, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Please enter your information below to send him in an email on this matter."/>
